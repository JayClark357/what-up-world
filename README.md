# What it is good people. I'm a new student to programming and am trying to take in as much info as I can on all the different aspects, options, and vernacular of the coding world. Its a lot to digest, but with time, I hope to make use of this and any information I can come across to better myself. 

# I'm currently studying Python for the next 4 wks, then C++. I'm told that there's a good amount of overlap in the laungauges and knowing more than one is normal and sometimes crucial for your success. Whatever, I'm able to learn, I hope to make the best of towards a fulfilling career path.

# Regards,
